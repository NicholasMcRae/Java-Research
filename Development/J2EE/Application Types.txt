- an EAR file requires a fully Java Platform, Enterprise Edition or Jakarta Enterprise edition to run
- a WAR file only requires a Java EE Web Profile compliant application server to run
- a JAR file only requires a Java installation
- The Java EE also defines a special type of JAR file that contains only Enterprise JavaBeans
	- has jar extension but contains a special deployment descriptor and is intended to isolate EJB components

- EAR files are a superset containing WAR files and JAR files
	- Java Application Servers allow deployment of standalone web modules in a WAR file, though internally they create EAR files as a wrapper around WAR files
	- standalone web containers such as Tomcat and Jetty do not support EAR files, these are not full-fledged Application servers
	- in application servers EAR files contain configurations such as application security role mapping, EJB reference mapping, and context root URL mapping of web modules
	- Apart from Web and EJB, EARs can also contain connector modules packaged as RAR files, and client modules packaged as Jar files
- Dynamic Web Project
	- requires only a servlet container, can't use enterprise features like the EJB container
- Enterprise Application Project
	- requires a servlet container
	- requires an EJB container
- if you need a project that will use JSP + JSF you are fine with a dynamic web project
