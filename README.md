This repo was originally used to make study notes for the book Effective Java, but more recently I'm focusing on the server and administration side of Java. So I've renamed the repo to capture both Java development and administration.

In my current role our Java applications are mostly stable so there isn't much opportunity for hands-on training on the administration side of things. I've already developed extensively with Java, so am making administration an area of focus in my spare time.
