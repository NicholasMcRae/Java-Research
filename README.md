This repo was originally used to make study notes for the book Effective Java, but more recently I'm trying to sharpen my understanding of the server and administration side of Java. So I've re-named the repo to capture both Java development and administration.

In my current role our Java applications are more or less stable so there isn't much opportunity for hands-on training on the admin side of things. I've already developed extensively with Java, so am making administration an area of focus in my spare time.
